/**
 * A JUCE-compatible host for a nam::DSP model, running in the chain domain
 * (kChainBaseSampleRate × oversampling factor; see ChainDomain.h).
 * Sample-rate conversion is NOT this class's job (the whole chain stage sits
 * behind one resampling boundary + oversampler in the processor), so all this
 * does is:
 *  - float ↔ double conversion (NAM models process NAM_SAMPLE == double),
 *  - mono processing with fan-out to stereo buffers,
 *  - slimmable (A2 container) tier selection,
 *  - phase-interleaved oversampled processing (below).
 *
 * Phase-interleaved oversampling:
 * A NAM model oversampled by N with its convolution dilations scaled by N is
 * mathematically identical to N independent copies of the *unscaled* model,
 * each processing every Nth sample of the oversampled stream at the native
 * rate: every scaled dilation lands taps exactly N samples apart (within one
 * phase), and 1×1 convolutions/activations are per-sample. So instead of
 * patching dilation scaling into NeuralAmpModelerCore, the engine holds N
 * instances of the same model and interleaves them. The receptive field stays
 * constant in seconds (the model sounds the same) while its nonlinear
 * harmonics land in the widened band where the chain's decimation filter
 * removes them instead of letting them alias.
 *
 * Recurrent architectures (LSTM) update state on consecutive samples and
 * can't be phase-split; the loader gives them a single instance that runs
 * time-scaled at the full chain rate (matching NAM-Oversampler's behavior
 * for such models). In practice every loadable model is phase-safe (the
 * catalog and the local-file gate only admit A2 WaveNets), so this is a
 * defensive path.
 *
 * Multi-core phases:
 * The phase instances are fully independent (separate models, disjoint
 * per-phase buffers), so process() can fork them across the processor's
 * RtWorkerPool (the same pool that forks the stereo lanes; a lane job
 * forking its phases is the pool's supported one-deep nesting). Scheduling
 * is the only thing that changes: deinterleave/reinterleave stay on the
 * calling thread and every phase writes only its own buffers, so parallel
 * output is bit-identical to serial. Passing no pool runs the classic
 * sequential loop.
